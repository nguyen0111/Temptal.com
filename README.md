Temptal is a collection of **customizable website templates** designed to jumpstart your development.
Each template is a blank but structured starting point — no clutter, no heavy frameworks — just a solid foundation you or your AI assistant can quickly extend into something unique.

Our model is simple:  
- Free users can explore a limited set of templates.  
- Premium subscribers unlock **unlimited access**.
